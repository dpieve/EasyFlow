## Usage

### Running on Linux

- Linux sounds implementation depends on ALSA architecture (read [NetCoreAudio](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetCoreAudio/2.0.0)). Therefore, the machine needs to have the utilities installed.

Run the following command or the equivalent for your system:
```bash
sudo apt-get install alsa-utils
```

### Data Handling

EasyFlow respects your privacy. It does not collect or store any personal data. All data is kept local to your device, ensuring that your productivity metrics are secure and confidential.
